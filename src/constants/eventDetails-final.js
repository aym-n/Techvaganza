The "bomb" is designed using  Arduino,logic gate ICs, LEDs, and buzzers to create a circuit that mimics a real defusal scenario. Teams will compete against each other to test their skills in electronics and logical thinking. Each round presents a unique circuit configuration, requiring teams to analyze and understand the logic gates involved to determine which wire to cut. Round 1: Teams defuse a basic "bomb" circuit with simple logic gates by cutting the correct wire within the time limit. Wrong cuts trigger the buzzer. Round 2: The circuit becomes more complex, with wrong cuts reducing the time limit. Teams must defuse it quickly to advance. Round 3: Teams face a dynamic circuit that reconfigures up to three times. They must adapt and defuse the "bomb" within the time limit to win.',
