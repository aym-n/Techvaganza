The challenge encourages creativity, teamwork, and problem-solving as participants apply the principles of fluid mechanics to lift a designated weight to a specific height. Prior to the event, each team must design their lift and collect the required materials based on provided design constraints and limitations.On the day of the event, participants will bring their pre-designed lifts and put them to the test under official judging criteria, including lifting capacity, stability, design creativity, and adherence to guidelines. The hydraulic lift must operate without external power sources, relying solely on the force generated by water-filled syringes and tubing. Teams will be judged on the efficiency of their hydraulic system, the quality of their build, and how well they follow the competition's constraints.The event is perfect for promoting STEM education, fostering innovation, and challenging participants to think critically and collaboratively. Whether you're a student, educator, or hobbyist, the Hydraulic Lift Challenge offers a fun, educational experience that showcases the power of hydraulics in everyday engineering.",

Teams will compete against each other to test their skills in electronics and logical thinking. Each round presents a unique circuit configuration, requiring teams to analyze and understand the logic gates involved to determine which wire to cut. Round 1: Teams defuse a basic \"bomb\" circuit with simple logic gates by cutting the correct wire within the time limit. Wrong cuts trigger the buzzer. Round 2: The circuit becomes more complex, with wrong cuts reducing the time limit. Teams must defuse it quickly to advance. Round 3: Teams face a dynamic circuit that reconfigures up to three times. They must adapt and defuse the \"bomb\" within the time limit to win.",
